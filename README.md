# WB-HID-MSE (µPoint)
## Modular Low-Power BLE Computer Mouse

WB-HID-MSE (µPoint) is a custom-designed, ultra-low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Human Interface Device (HID) mouse built around the STM32WB series microcontroller. The project focuses on modular hardware design, power efficiency, and embedded firmware architecture.

This repository contains the hardware design files, firmware source code, and documentation for the µPoint platform.

## Project Goals
- Design a custom PCB for a wireless BLE mouse
- Implement BLE HID using an integrated RF MCU
- Optimize power consumption for battery-powered operation
- Enable modular, replaceable hardware components
- Follow industry standard design practices. 
- Learn and have fun along the way!
