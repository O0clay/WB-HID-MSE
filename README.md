# WB-HID-MSE (µPoint)
##Modular Low-Power BLE Computer Mouse

WB-HID-MSE (µPoint) is a custom-designed, ultra-low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Human Interface Device (HID) mouse built around the STM32WB series microcontroller. The project focuses on modular hardware design, power efficiency, and product-grade embedded firmware architecture.

This repository contains the hardware design files, firmware source code, and documentation for the µPoint platform.

##Project Goals
1.) Design a custom PCB for a wireless BLE mouse
2.) Implement BLE HID using an integrated RF MCU
3.) Optimize power consumption for battery-powered operation
4.) Enable modular, replaceable hardware components
5.) Follow industry standard design practices.
